This is the sixth iteration of my world download for version 1.2.4. Let me know in the comment section what you want added in
future versions! Included in this zip folder will be an image of the entire world since v2 to show what's new around.

To install the world, simply drag and drop (or copy and paste) the two '.wld' & '.wld.bak' files into 
"C:\Users\*USERNAME*\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds", or the equivalent if you have it some where else. 
Rename BOTH files if it conflicts with another save or simply make a copy just in case.
